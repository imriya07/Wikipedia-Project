        <h2>Nature- A Boon for All</h2>
        <p>Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. 
            It is our companion since eternity. Despite the importance of 
            nature in human life, we are spoiling its balance only due to 
            our greediness. Millions of years ago, when the knowledge of man 
            was not better than an animal. At that time man used to get all the 
            things needed for life only from nature. Even today, at the heights 
            of science, our requirements are met by nature only. Nature is a boon 
            given to us, as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the 
            earth. It gives us forests which are the lungs of Earth.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenges of Nature</h2>
        <p>Our lives as human beings started on this planet Earth and since then we are
             exhausting its resources. But, in return, we are exposing it to the external
              threats of destruction and mistreatment. Due to this, beautiful forests have
               been destroyed, rivers have been polluted and vast open lands have been consumed 
               for buildings and factories. We are giving challenges to nature by doing activities
                as hunting down animals, cutting down trees, releasing poisonous gases and polluting 
                rivers.Our earth is literally experiencing many strokes of destructive activities due
                 to which the river sources are going dry, plants are dying as well as species are eliminating.
                  Today’s world is facing the biggest problem of ‘global warming’, which has a serious impact on 
                  our environment. So we all think seriously about our activities and help to bring such situations 
                  under control.</p>
        <h2>Conservation of Nature</h2>
        <p>Conservation of nature is another important issue. Although governments are employing various means to 
            conserve nature, individuals must also come forward to contribute to saving nature. Therefore, everyone
             must do the tree plantation, restricting the use of paper, stopping wastage of water and electricity. 
             Not only these we have to stop ill practices like the hunting of animals. Also, we must go for rainwater
              harvesting systems. If each one of us contributes their own bit, the difference will be tremendous for 
              nature. The beginning of life, as well as the continuation of life on earth both, are a very complex process
               of nature. Every organism is important for the conservation of nature.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In the end, I would just say that please don’t keep my words to yourself only. I request all to spread the message
             around so that every person can become a responsible global citizen who can contribute to saving our planet.
             Also, focus on energy consumption. Therefore, switch off the power button, if no one is in the room. Do not use 
             personal vehicles, and follow public transportation. We can even use bicycles for small distances to protect your 
             environment. Thus, through these simple yet effective measures, everyone can contribute greatly towards saving our 
             mother nature from further exploitation.</p>
